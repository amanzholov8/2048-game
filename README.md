# 2048-game

This project is based on http://otfried.org/courses/cs109/project-2048.html

To run the program, you will need to move cs109.jar and cs109ui.jar files (author: Otfried Cheong) to the Kotlin's lib folder.

To play the game with simple text display, compile and run "game.kt" file. (To compile, type in the terminal "ktc game.kt". To run, type "kt GameKt")

To play the game with graphical display, compile and run "uigame.kt" file. (To compile, type in the terminal "ktc uigame.kt". To run, type "kt UigameKt")

Use R, L, U, D to control the blocks.
